# Python Chess Engine

## Chess engine developed using python, pygame, and numpy

Python chess engine minus the smart engine part. Have move generation most of the way there with support for things like castling, pinned pieces, check, random AI moves, and basic move generation. Still need to make checks have an impact on pieces besides the king. Also includes some quality of life features like undoing, resetting the board, partial FEN string support (pieces, side to move) loading and retrieving from a game state, and different title and pawn promotion screens.

Shortcuts:
* z -> undo
* t -> toggle between AI & solo play
* r -> reset board to starting position
